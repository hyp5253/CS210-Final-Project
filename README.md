## Game Lore

```plaintext
Once, he was a hero—a knight whose name echoed through the halls of kings and the songs of bards. 
They called him Aldric the Undying, the Protector of Lyveria. He had everything a man could dream of: a 
noble cause, a kingdom’s gratitude, and a family waiting in the warm glow of the hearth. But no light lasts forever.

The day came when the skies turned red, and the earth cracked open. Shadows spilled forth, led by 
a sorcerer whose power twisted the laws of nature. Aldric led the charge, blade in hand, against the dark tide. 
Victory came at a terrible cost. His comrades fell, his home was razed, and the family he cherished vanished in 
the chaos. The sorcerer’s laughter haunted his dreams, and Aldric was left with only questions—and a burning guilt.

Now, the knight wanders the broken lands, his armor tarnished and his heart heavy. He has traded his title for 
solitude, his fame for survival. Yet, the whispers of hope remain: rumors of dungeons where the sorcerer’s minions 
guard treasures beyond imagination. Treasures that might lead Aldric to what he has lost.

Each dungeon is a test—a labyrinth filled with traps, creatures born of nightmares, and fragments of a truth that 
might finally set him free. For Aldric, there is no turning back. If redemption lies at the heart of these dungeons, 
then he will face every shadow and wield his blade until his last breath.
